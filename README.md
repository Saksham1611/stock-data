## Install the project on your System 
```bash
mkdir -p assignment/project1
cd assignment/project1
```
#### Activate virtual environment
```python
python3- m venv environmentname(venv)
activate venv
```
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Package version of project remains unaffected when you update any library in local environment

```git
git clone <url of the project>
```

#### Optional One more thing to take care of is to attach a requirements file. Generate one by 
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
